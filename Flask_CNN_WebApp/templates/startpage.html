  <h1>Real-Time Sign Detection and Recognition</h1>
  <p class="content">
In this Project, initially we are going to trained a model using sign images. Then by using the
model we are going to detect the real-time sign actions performed by the user. This work
main focus is on creating a vision-based system able to do real-time sign language
recognition. The reason for choosing a system based on vision relates to the fact that
it provides a simpler and more intuitive way of communication between a human and
a computer. Being hand-pose one of the most important communication tools in
humanâ€™s daily life, and with the continuous advances of image and video processing
techniques, research on human-machine interaction through gesture recognition led to
the use of such technology in a very broad range of applications, like touch screens,
video game consoles, virtual reality, medical applications, and sign language
recognition. We will use Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN, model to classify the static images.  </p>
